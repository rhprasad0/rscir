# Composed Image Retrieval for Remote Sensing

Long story short, the embeddings from RemoteCLIP were thrown into pgvector and the weighting scheme described in the paper is implemented in normalize_similiarities.sql.

A very Flask app that implements that query was thrown on AWS EC2 + RDS and was up for a week. The app was similar to the demo.mp4 video.
